# Development-of-an-Energy-Efficient-IoT-Based-Smart-Lighting-System-Using-Machine-Learning
This study introduces an IoT-based smart lighting system using a Random Forest Regression model to optimize energy use by predicting lighting needs from three inputs: time of day (0–23 h), motion (0 or 1), and ambient light (0–100).
