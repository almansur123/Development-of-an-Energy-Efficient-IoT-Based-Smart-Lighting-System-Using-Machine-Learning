# Development-of-an-Energy-Efficient-IoT-Based-Smart-Lighting-System-Using-Machine-Learning
This study introduces an IoT-based smart lighting system using a Random Forest Regression model to optimize energy use by predicting lighting needs from three inputs: time of day (0–23 h), motion (0 or 1), and ambient light (0–100). Unlike traditional systems that run at 100% brightness on motion detection, this approach adapts lighting dynamically. A synthetic dataset of 1,000 samples was used for training (80%) and testing (20%), yielding low Mean Squared Error. The system includes IoT sensors, a cloud-based ML engine, and a control unit to adjust light levels. Simulation results show a reduction in energy use from 80.4 kWh (baseline) to 50.3 kWh, achieving 30.1 kWh (∼37%) savings. The findings demonstrate the potential of combining IoT and ML for intelligent, energy-efficient lighting, with future plans for real-world testing and added features like weather and user input.
